# AI Intrusion Detection System ðŸš€

## Overview

This project provides an advanced AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built with Python, TensorFlow, and Scapy. It can be trained on the **UNSW-NB15 dataset** to learn the difference between normal and malicious network traffic, and then used to analyze live network connections in real-time.

The system is composed of two main scripts:
* `AITrain.py`: A script to automatically download the dataset, preprocess it, perform feature selection, and train a hyperparameter-tuned neural network.
* `IDS.py`: A script that uses a trained model to monitor a live network interface and alert on suspicious activity.

## Project Structure

The project uses the following directory structure. The `pretrained/` folder contains a ready-to-use model and its associated files.

```
/ai-intrusion-detection-system
|-- /pretrained
|   |-- ids_final_model.keras
|   |-- scaler.gz
|   |-- model_columns.pkl
|   |-- best_threshold.pkl
|-- AITrain.py
|-- IDS.py
|-- README.md
```

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

First, clone the repository and install the necessary software and libraries.

**For all Operating Systems:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-intrusion-detection-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-intrusion-detection-system.git)
cd ai-intrusion-detection-system

# Install the required Python libraries
pip install tensorflow pandas scapy numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib kagglehub keras-tuner
```

**For Windows Users (Required):**
You must install **Npcap** for packet capturing to work.
1.  Download the latest installer from the [**Npcap Official Website**](https://npcap.com).
2.  During installation, ensure the following options are checked:
    * **"Support raw 802.11 traffic (and monitor mode)"**
    * **"Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode"**

### 2. Training a New Model (Optional)

While a high-performance pre-trained model is provided, you can also train your own model from scratch by following these steps.

1.  **Kaggle API Credentials:**
    The training script needs Kaggle credentials to download the dataset.
    * Go to your Kaggle account settings (`https://www.kaggle.com/settings`).
    * Click `Create New Token` to download a `kaggle.json` file.
    * The script will prompt for your Kaggle username and API key from this file when you first run it.

2.  **Run the Training Script:**
    Execute the `AITrain.py` script from your terminal. This will create a new set of four model files in the project's root directory.
    ```bash
    python AITrain.py
    ```

---

## Usage

The script needs root/administrator privileges and a network interface to monitor. You can choose to use the included pre-trained model or a model you have trained yourself.

### Using the Pre-Trained Model (Recommended)
To use the high-performance model included in the `pretrained/` folder, add the `--use-pretrained` flag to the command.

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Example using a wired interface
sudo python IDS.py --interface eth0 --use-pretrained
```

**On Windows (as Administrator):**
```powershell
# Example using a Wi-Fi interface
python IDS.py --interface "Wi-Fi" --use-pretrained
```

### Using a Self-Trained Model
If you have run `AITrain.py` and have your own set of model files in the project's root directory, simply run the command **without** the `--use-pretrained` flag.

**On Linux/macOS:**
```bash
sudo python IDS.py --interface eth0
```

**On Windows (as Administrator):**
```powershell
python IDS.py --interface "Wi-Fi"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: `Layer ['tcp'] not found` or `Interface not found` on Windows**

This is a common issue related to how packet capture libraries interact with Windows drivers. If problems persist:
1.  **Reinstall Npcap:** Ensure you have installed Npcap with the correct settings mentioned in the prerequisites.
2.  **Check Interface Name:** Use `python -c "from scapy.all import get_windows_if_list; print(get_windows_if_list())"` to find the exact name.
3.  **Wi-Fi Adapter Limitations:** Most built-in laptop Wi-Fi cards do not support monitor mode on Windows. If the script fails on Wi-Fi but works on a wired Ethernet connection, this is the cause.
